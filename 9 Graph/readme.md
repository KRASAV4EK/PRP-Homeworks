# 9 Homework

In this task, the task is to implement a library for loading and saving a data structure (graph) from/to a file, both in textual representation and in binary form. 
The aim of the homework is therefore primarily to practice working with files. 
The input entry of the graph is prescribed and the graph is entered as a list of edges, where each edge is defined by the number of the starting vertex, the number of the ending vertex and then an integer indicating the cost of the edge. 
All numeric values correspond to the range of a 32-bit integer, type int.

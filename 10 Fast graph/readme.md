# 10 Homework

The goal of the task is to integrate an existing solution for finding the shortest path (cheapest) path to all nodes of an oriented positive-valued graph, and for simplicity, always only from the first node of the graph (i.e., node number 0). 
The program uses a heap priority queue implementation, which is represented as a binary full tree stored in an array. 
However, for efficient use of the priority queue in the search for the shortest paths, it is advisable to implement the update() function.
